\begin{problem}{Shortest Path}{path.in}{path.out}{2 seconds}{64 megabytes}

% Author: Andrew Stankevich

You are given a weighed directed graph and a vertex $s$ in it.
For each vertex $u$ find the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $u$.

\InputFile

The first line of the input file contains $n$, $m$ and $s$ --- the number
of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of the starting
vertex, respectively ($2 \le n \le 2\,000$, $1 \le m \le 5\,000$). 

The following $m$ lines describe edges. Each
edge is specified with its start vertex, its end vertex, and its weight.
The weight of any edge is integer and does not exceed $10^{15}$ by its 
absolute value. There can be several edges between a pair of vertices. 
There can be an edge between a vertex and itself.

\OutputFile

Output $n$ lines --- for each vertex $u$ output the length
of the shortest path from $s$ to $u$, `\t{*}' if there is no path
from $s$ to $u$, or `\t{-}' if there is no shortest path from $s$ 
to $u$.
